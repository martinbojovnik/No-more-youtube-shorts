# No more shorts on youtube

I find myself addicted to youtube shorts. And so I create this Grease Monkey Script to redirect me at **[rock one eyebrow raised gif](https://tenor.com/view/rock-one-eyebrow-raised-rock-staring-the-rock-gif-22113367)** whenever I click on shorts.

## Running this script ##  

To run this code you will first need some kind of js script injection  

```
1. Change RedirectURL in index.js to the URL that you want to be redirected whenever you click om shorts  
2. Copy code from index.js and paste it to the js injection of your choice
```
Now you will never see any shorts anymore
